# Blend Modes

Seahorse supports the following blend modes:

## Addition

The filter calculates the sum of color components in the two input images to produce a brightening effect. People typically use this filter to add highlights and lens flares.

## Color

This method applies the color-blend mode filter to an image. The effect creates the output image by using the luminance values of the background image, while using the hue and saturation values of the input image. The effect preserves gray levels from the background image.
